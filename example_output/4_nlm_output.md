    ## Prospect Intelligence Summary Report: JUSTPARK PARKING LIMITED

    ## 1. COMPANY OVERVIEW
    JUSTPARK PARKING LIMITED is a PE-backed private company operating in the Technology, Marketplace, and Parking Solutions industry. It functions as a high-volume, real-time transactional marketplace connecting over 13 million drivers (B2C) with B2B and B2G space owners. Headquartered in London, UK, the company underwent a significant strategic shift when it merged with US-based ParkHub in March 2024, supported by FTV Capital and LLR Partners. This merger enabled official expansion into the North American market, launched in January 2025. Strategic priorities include post-merger unification of platforms, geographic expansion, and driving adoption of B2B data tools like "JustPark Insights," which utilize AI-driven projections. Verified employee count and annual revenue figures are NOT FOUND.

    ## 2. INDUSTRY CONTEXT
    The UK sharing economy market is characterized by a Dual-State maturity: mature B2C segments coexist with high-growth B2B/AI platform segments. A clear strategic shift is occurring towards B2B platform models, often powered by AI, with AI-Driven B2B SaaS platforms representing the largest growth area, contributing £11.8 billion GVA to the UK economy. Cloud adoption is mature and strategic drivers have shifted from cost savings to innovation and scalability. The top operational challenge for scaling platforms is **Cloud Cost Management (FinOps)**, which is cited as a larger concern than security. Regulatory risk is the #1 strategic risk for UK platforms. JustPark's core compliance burden is the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and UK data protection regulations, as it acts as a data controller for millions of drivers. Emerging regulations include the **Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers (DMCC) Act 2024** and new legislation extending Right to Work check obligations to platform worker models, carrying fines up to £60,000 per illegal worker. The company holds no publicly verifiable certifications such as ISO 27001 or SOC 2.

    ## 3. TECHNOLOGY ENVIRONMENT
    JustPark operates a cloud-native stack primarily on **AWS**. The infrastructure is complex, leveraging container orchestration via **Amazon EKS** (Kubernetes) alongside serverless components like **AWS Fargate** and **AWS Lambda**. The architecture is transitioning from a **legacy PHP application** monolith to microservices built primarily in **Go (Golang)** and **Python**, leveraging frameworks such as Django. The front-end uses modern JavaScript, **React**, and **TypeScript**, with familiarity with Next.js. CI/CD pipelines are built using **GitLab CI/CD** with **GitLab** repositories, while the organization also utilizes **GitHub** and **GitHub Actions**. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is implemented using **Terraform**. Core persistence layers include **Amazon Aurora** and **PostgreSQL**, with caching handled by **Amazon ElastiCache**. Monitoring and observability include experience with **Datadog** (or Prometheus/Grafana). **Critical technology gaps** identified in public research include the lack of verified **CSPM/CWPP/CNAPP** solutions, specific tools for **SIEM/SOAR**, and an explicit **secrets management** solution. No evidence of multi-cloud usage (Azure or GCP) was found.

    ## 4. ORGANIZATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
    Key executive stakeholders driving the combined global entity include Global CEO Jeff Shanahan (with a background in FinTech and payments), UK President Anthony Eskinazi, CTO Todd Marshall (responsible for platform scalability and technical integration), and COO Jonathan Hampson. Crucially, the **CISO/Head of Security and CFO are NOT FOUND** in public sources, indicating potential discovery questions around security ownership and budget control. The company's hiring focus is on high-impact senior talent (e.g., Lead Engineers) to manage core systems, rather than mass expansion. Current major initiatives are the post-merger unification, which requires secure and scalable API integration between the two platforms (B2C and B2B), and the newly executed North American expansion. Identified pain points include the challenge of talent retention post-merger, a critical need for technical scalability involving "advanced redundancy and failover mechanisms" to meet contracted B2B uptime (>99.9%), and a history of switching vendors due to reliability issues.

    ## 5. SECURITY POSTURE & GAPS
    JustPark's security function is currently assessed as **Developing**, with visible gaps in cloud infrastructure security. Existing security coverage is focused on the application layer, utilizing **Snyk** (SAST/DAST) and **SonarQube** (SAST) for pipeline scanning. Identity is managed via **Okta**, and perimeter protection includes **Cloudflare** for WAF/CDN services. Cloud-native security visibility gaps are significant: solutions for **CSPM, CWPP, and CNAPP** are Not identified in research. The reliance on complex AWS services (EKS, Fargate, Lambda) demands robust configuration management to maintain security posture. Further operational security gaps include the lack of publicly identified **SIEM/SOAR** solutions for threat correlation, and a specific **IaC scanning tool** for their **Terraform** usage. The primary compliance requirement is **GDPR** and UK data protection regulations. A key risk factor is the lack of public security leadership (CISO/Head of Security) and the absence of verified compliance certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2).

    ## 6. BUYING SIGNALS & PRIORITIES
    The primary urgency indicator is the ongoing **post-merger unification** (March 2024) and recent **North American market entry** (January 2025), which mandate technical integration and scaling across international jurisdictions. Strategic priorities are platform resilience and scalability to ensure the critical **>99.9% uptime** commitment is met, and driving B2B/B2G growth through data-driven "JustPark Insights". The company, being PE-backed, will prioritize solutions with a clear ROI. Budget context suggests strong motivation for investments that support growth and efficiency, but also tools focused on **FinOps** (Cloud Cost Management), which is an industry-wide imperative. The technology team's use of **GitLab CI/CD** and **Terraform** indicates a strong focus on developer velocity and automated delivery. The need to integrate and secure a hybrid microservices stack (Go/Python, EKS/Fargate/Lambda) presents a high-priority buying signal for tools that consolidate security and observability across these different environments.
