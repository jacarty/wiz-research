| **(Medium Readiness / High Influence)** | **Position:** Highest C-Suite. **Influence Level:** **Ultimate Decision-Maker**. | **Challenges:** Maintaining talent/cohesion post-merger. High expectations from PE owners for growth and efficiency. Technical failure and security breaches directly undermine the core value proposition of simplification. | **Wiz Impact:** Prevents catastrophic security incidents that lead to brand erosion and financial fines (PE investor risk mitigation). Enables B2B/B2G data initiatives by guaranteeing **data governance**. | **Quick Wins:** Present a 1-page **Executive Risk Snapshot** focusing on the critical, internet-facing assets in their production environment. **Executive Sponsorship:** Position Wiz as a **strategic platform for trust and scaling**, rather than just a security tool—it protects the PE investment and enables expansion. **Enablement:** High-level executive briefings comparing JustPark’s security maturity (vis-à-vis gaps) to UK platform leaders (Synthesia, Payhawk). **Relationship Tactics:** Executive briefing focused on **attack surface management (ASM)** and platform resilience, aligning with their public commitment to ">99.9% uptime". |

Provide a report identifying **security misconfigurations that create single points of failure** in their AWS infrastructure. **Executive Sponsorship:** Needs buy-in from the CTO that this solution simplifies security operations and improves MTTR. **Enablement:** Data showing how Wiz's CDR capabilities align with their need for **24/7 global platform management**. **Relationship Tactics:** Discuss the concept of **"Trust and Safety as a Product"** (a critical success factor for platforms) and how security drives operational stability. |

## Discovery Gaps to Enhance the Plan

The sources indicate critical gaps that must be filled to finalize the champion plan and execute a sale, particularly regarding the security function:

1.  **CISO/Head of Security Identification:** The single most important discovery gap is identifying the individual responsible for security and compliance strategy in the UK, and understanding their reporting structure (CTO, COO, or Global CISO).
    *   **Recommended Question:** "Who leads your security and compliance strategy in the UK, and how does that function coordinate with the global entity post-merger?".
2.  **IaC Scanning Specifics:** While JustPark uses **Terraform**, the specific tool for scanning IaC pre-deployment is unknown.
    *   **Recommended Question:** "Given your team is hiring for Terraform experience, how are you currently scanning your Terraform files for security misconfigurations *before* they get to a production environment?".
3.  **Secrets Management:** There is **no public evidence** regarding how JustPark manages and injects secrets (like database passwords) into their EKS/CI/CD pipelines.
    *   **Recommended Question:** "Given your use of Terraform and Kubernetes, how do you securely manage and inject **secrets** (like database passwords and API keys) into your applications and CI/CD pipelines?".
4.  **Certifications Requirement:** The need for specific security certifications (e.g., ISO 27001) for B2B/B2G sales is unverified.
    *   **Recommended Question:** "As you expand into B2B and public sector sales via G-Cloud, have you found that customers are requiring you to hold certifications like ISO 27001 or Cyber Essentials?".
