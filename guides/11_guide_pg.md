## Quality Checklist

Before you send, verify:
- [ ] Mentions something specific about their company/industry
- [ ] Focuses on business value (not Wiz features)
- [ ] Appropriate tone for relationship stage
- [ ] Clear, easy call-to-action
- [ ] Sounds human (not robotic)

## Tips

**For Better Outputs:**
- More context = better messages (use those trigger events!)
- Test both versions (A/B test)
- The prompt knows persona priorities - trust it
- Customize with your own voice before sending

**Common Fixes:**
- Too formal? → Change "Cold" to "Warm" stage
- Too long? → The prompt already limits to 60-100 words
- Too generic? → Add a specific pain point from research

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Message doesn't feel personalized"**
→ Did you upload all three research reports to NotebookLM?

**"Wrong tone for relationship"**
→ Double-check you selected the right Stage (Cold/Warm/etc.)

**"Not getting talk track bullets"**
→ Make sure you selected "Call" as the Type
