## SECTION 3: CLOUD & TECHNOLOGY ENVIRONMENT

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT FOR THIS SECTION**: Only include VERIFIED information with direct sources. Do NOT make assumptions about technology stack based on job postings alone, industry norms, or indirect evidence. If you cannot find a direct source confirming a technology is in use, mark it as NOT FOUND rather than assuming.

Technology stack information is business-critical for solution positioning and must be accurate. Mark anything as ASSUMED only if you have strong indirect evidence (e.g., multiple job postings + conference talk + case study), and always explain the basis clearly.

### 3.1 Cloud Infrastructure & Architecture

- **Data centre presence** or colocation arrangements (if mentioned)
- **Edge computing or distributed architecture** references

**Research approach**: 
- **VERIFIED sources only**: Cloud provider case studies, official company tech blogs, conference presentations by company engineers, official partnership announcements
- **Strong evidence for ASSUMED**: Multiple job postings (3+) requiring specific cloud platform PLUS other corroborating evidence
- **Weak evidence (do NOT use)**: Single job posting, general industry patterns, competitor similarities
- Review job postings for cloud platform requirements only as supporting evidence, not primary source
- Check for cloud provider case studies featuring the company (AWS Customer Stories, Azure Case Studies, GCP Customer Success)
- Look for conference talks or blog posts about their architecture where engineers explicitly discuss platforms
- Review technology partnership announcements from cloud providers

**Examples of VERIFIED technology information**:
- "AWS mentioned in official case study published by AWS"
- "Engineering blog post shows architecture diagram with Azure services"
- "CTO discussed Kubernetes deployment at KubeCon presentation"

**Examples that must be marked ASSUMED**:
- "5 job postings require AWS experience" (ASSUMED - likely uses AWS based on job requirements)
- "Typical for fintech companies" (ASSUMED - industry pattern, not verified for this company)
- "LinkedIn shows cloud engineers" (ASSUMED - presence of cloud roles suggests cloud usage but doesn't confirm platform)

**Required sources**: Cloud provider case studies (AWS/Azure/GCP customer stories), company tech blog, conference presentations (with links to slides/videos), official partnership announcements, company published architecture documentation

### 3.2 Development Practices & DevOps Maturity

- Open source projects published by the company showing languages/frameworks
- Official job descriptions (but only as supporting evidence, not sole source)

**Mark as ASSUMED if**:
- Only source is job postings
- Inferred from industry norms or peer companies
- Based on general statements without specific tool/platform mentions

**Required sources**: Company tech blog (official), GitHub organization (if exists), conference presentations with video/slides, published case studies, developer documentation (official)

### 3.3 Current Technology Stack & Security Tools
Research and document:

**CRITICAL**: This section is essential for competitive positioning. Only include VERIFIED information about security tools and platforms actually in use. Do NOT assume based solely on job postings.

- **Known security vendors or tools** (VERIFIED from case studies, partnership announcements, conference talks)
- **SIEM or SOC platform mentions** (Splunk, Elastic, etc. - must have direct source)
- **Identity and access management** (Okta, Azure AD, etc. - must be explicitly mentioned)
- **Cloud security tools** currently in use (must have confirmation beyond job postings)
- **Compliance or GRC platforms** referenced in official sources
- **Developer security tools** (SAST, DAST tools - must be explicitly mentioned in tech content)

**VERIFIED Security Tool Sources ONLY**:
- Technology partner case studies or press releases
- Conference presentations where security tools are demonstrated or discussed
- Official company security page listing integrations or certifications

- **Never make assumptions or inferences without evidence**
- **If information cannot be found, explicitly state "NOT FOUND" or "NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE"**
- **Do not fill gaps with industry assumptions or typical patterns**
- **Do not infer stakeholder priorities without direct evidence**
- **When uncertain, mark as "UNVERIFIED" rather than stating as fact**

For each research finding, use this format:

**[Data Point or Insight Title]**
- **Status**: [VERIFIED or ASSUMED]
- **Finding**: [Specific information discovered]
- **Source**: [Full URL if verified, or "Not publicly available - inferred from [basis]" if assumed]
- **Date**: [Publication or access date]
- **Reliability**: [Official company source / News article / Analyst report / Job posting / Social media / Inferred]
- **Relevant Quote/Reference**: "[Direct quote or key excerpt if applicable]"
- **Analysis**: [1-2 sentences on what this means for Wiz positioning - clearly marked as interpretation]

### VERIFIED vs ASSUMED Definitions:

**VERIFIED Information**: 
- Has a direct, public source that explicitly states the information
- Can be cited with a specific URL, document, or public record
- Examples: Company registered address from Companies House, cloud provider mentioned in case study, executive name from company website, certifications listed on company website

**ASSUMED Information**:
- Inferred or deduced from indirect evidence
- Based on industry norms, job posting patterns, or logical conclusions
- No direct public statement confirms this information
- Must be clearly labeled as **ASSUMED** and explain the basis for the assumption
- Examples: "ASSUMED - Based on 5 AWS job postings, likely primary cloud provider" or "ASSUMED - Typical for UK fintech companies of this size based on industry benchmarks"

**Critical Rule**: When in doubt, mark as ASSUMED. It's better to be conservative and transparent about information certainty.

If information cannot be found for any research area:

**[Data Point Title]**
- **Status**: NOT FOUND
- **Finding**: NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE
- **Search Attempted**: [Brief description of what was searched]
- **Implication**: [What this gap means for the research - e.g., "Will need to gather during discovery calls"]

---

## EXAMPLE RESEARCH OUTPUT SNIPPETS

### Example 1: Fully Verified Information
**Company Headquarters Location**
- **Status**: VERIFIED
- **Finding**: Monzo Bank headquarters located in London, UK (Broadwalk House, 5 Appold St, London EC2A 2AG)
- **Source**: https://monzo.com/contact-us and https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09446231
- **Date**: Accessed October 2025
- **Reliability**: Official company source + Companies House record
- **Analysis**: London location indicates access to UK fintech talent pool and proximity to FCA regulation. Likely influenced by UK-specific cloud data residency requirements.

### Example 2: Verified Technical Information with Direct Evidence
**Cloud Infrastructure Evidence**
- **Status**: VERIFIED
- **Finding**: Monzo runs primarily on AWS, with services spanning multiple availability zones. Engineering blog confirms use of EKS (Kubernetes), Lambda, RDS, and S3.
- **Source**: https://monzo.com/blog/2024/06/15/cloud-architecture-evolution
- **Date**: June 2024
- **Reliability**: Official company tech blog
- **Relevant Quote**: "Our entire platform runs on AWS, leveraging managed services wherever possible to maintain our small infrastructure team's efficiency"
- **Analysis**: Strong AWS footprint makes Wiz Cloud a natural fit. Kubernetes usage indicates need for container security. Small infrastructure team suggests appetite for agentless, low-overhead solutions.

### Example 3: Partially Verified, Partially Assumed
**Current Security Team Size**
- **Status**: VERIFIED (team size) + ASSUMED (growth trajectory)
- **Finding**: LinkedIn shows 12 employees with "Security" in job title at Monzo, including CISO. Current verified count: 12. ASSUMED: Growing security function based on 3 active job openings for Security Engineers.
- **Source**: LinkedIn company page employee search (verified count) + https://monzo.com/careers (job openings)
- **Date**: October 2025
- **Reliability**: Medium-high (LinkedIn data + official job postings)
- **Analysis**: Security team of ~12 people for a company of 2,500 employees suggests resource constraints (verified). Active hiring patterns suggest potential urgency for force multiplication tools like Wiz (assumed based on job openings).

### Example 4: Assumed Information with Clear Basis
**Monitoring Tool Usage**
- **Status**: ASSUMED
- **Finding**: Likely uses Datadog for monitoring based on: (1) 4 current job postings requiring Datadog experience, (2) Datadog case study featuring Monzo from 2023, (3) Engineering team member LinkedIn profile listing Datadog skills. However, current active usage cannot be definitively confirmed.
- **Source**: https://monzo.com/careers (job postings) + https://datadog.com/case-studies/monzo-2023 + LinkedIn profiles
- **Date**: October 2025
- **Reliability**: Inferred from multiple indirect sources
- **Analysis**: Strong indirect evidence suggests Datadog usage, but this should be validated in discovery calls before positioning integration or competitive displacement strategies. If accurate, represents potential integration point for Wiz.

### Example 5: Information Not Found
**Current Cloud Security Platform**
- **Status**: NOT FOUND
- **Finding**: NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE - No public information available about current CSPM, CNAPP, or cloud security platform in use.
- **Search Attempted**: Searched company tech blog, press releases, job postings (checked for Prisma Cloud, Orca, Wiz, Lacework, etc.), partner case studies, conference presentations. No explicit mentions found.
- **Implication**: Critical gap for competitive positioning. Must gather during discovery calls with questions like: "What cloud security tools are you currently using? What's working well and what challenges are you facing?" This is a potential greenfield opportunity or displacement situation that requires validation.

### Example 6: Verified Personal Information with Gaps
**CISO Security Philosophy**
- **Status**: VERIFIED (background) + NOT FOUND (current priorities)
- **Finding**: CISO is Jane Smith (LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/janesmith). Background includes 10 years in fintech security, previously Head of Security at Revolut (2018-2023) per LinkedIn profile.
- **Source**: https://www.linkedin.com/in/janesmith and https://monzo.com/about/leadership
- **Date**: October 2025
- **Reliability**: Official LinkedIn + company leadership page
- **Relevant Quote**: From LinkedIn: "Passionate about building security into product development from day one"
- **Analysis**: Quote suggests DevSecOps mindset and shift-left approach, aligning well with Wiz Code positioning. 
- **NOTE**: Specific security priorities for Monzo NOT FOUND publicly - will require discovery conversation.

### Example 6: Correcting Assumptions - Single Cloud vs Multi-Cloud
**Multi-Cloud Strategy**
- **Status**: VERIFIED (AWS) + NOT FOUND (Azure/GCP)
- **Finding**: AWS confirmed as primary cloud provider [see Cloud Infrastructure Evidence above]. No evidence found for Azure or GCP usage.
- **Search Attempted**: Job postings, tech blog, conference talks, case studies
- **Sources Checked**: Company blog, LinkedIn job posts, GitHub, cloud provider case study databases
- **Analysis**: Single-cloud (AWS) based on available evidence. Do NOT assume multi-cloud without evidence. Single-cloud AWS environment simplifies Wiz deployment and reduces complexity in proof-of-value. Do not position multi-cloud benefits without confirmation during discovery.
- **Important**: Many assume fintech companies use multi-cloud, but this must be VERIFIED not ASSUMED. Any multi-cloud usage NOT VERIFIED and should be confirmed in technical discovery calls.
