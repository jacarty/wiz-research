### ‚ùì Knowledge Gaps & Assumptions

#### Critical Unknowns
- **IaC scanning solution**: No public information found on infrastructure-as-code security scanning
- **SIEM platform**: Unknown what they use for log aggregation and security monitoring
- **Multi-cloud presence**: Confirmed AWS, unclear if also using Azure/GCP
- **Mobile development**: No evidence of mobile apps or mobile tech stack
- **Secrets management**: No information on how they handle secrets/credentials
- **ERP system**: Unknown if using enterprise resource planning software

#### Reasonable Assumptions (Flagged as Unverified)
- **Assumption**: Likely using TypeScript with React (based on modern frontend job requirements)
  - **Why reasonable**: Job postings emphasize "modern JavaScript" and type safety
  - **Verification needed**: Confirm in technical discovery

- **Assumption**: Probably using Docker for containerization (based on Kubernetes use)
  - **Why reasonable**: K8s requires container runtime, Docker is standard
  - **Verification needed**: Ask what container tooling they use

- **Assumption**: Likely using GitHub Advanced Security (based on GitHub Enterprise use + engineering blog focus on security)
  - **Why reasonable**: Company size (500+ engineers) and security maturity indicators suggest need for code scanning
  - **Verification needed**: Confirm in discovery conversation

- **Assumption**: Probably have basic cloud-native monitoring (CloudWatch)
  - **Why reasonable**: Standard with AWS, mentioned in passing in blog
  - **Verification needed**: Ask what visibility gaps exist

#### Missing Categories
**Languages**:
- [ ] No evidence of: .NET/C# (unclear if using Microsoft stack)
- [ ] No evidence of: Java (possible gap or not used)
- [ ] Unknown: Database languages (SQL variants, NoSQL)

**Applications**:
- [ ] Unknown: ERP/finance systems
- [ ] Unknown: HR/payroll systems
- [ ] No evidence of: Marketing automation platform
- [ ] Unknown: Customer support ticketing system

**Security**:
- [ ] No evidence of: Secrets management tool (Vault, etc.)
- [ ] No evidence of: API security solution

- ‚úÖ Last 50 job postings (past 6 months)
- ‚úÖ LinkedIn (25+ relevant employee profiles)
- ‚úÖ Vendor case study databases (Salesforce, AWS, Datadog)
- ‚úÖ Conference presentation archives (2 talks found)
- ‚úÖ GitHub (public repositories analyzed)
- ‚ùå No Stack Overflow company page found

- Some tools may be in pilot/POC phase
- Legacy applications not visible in public hiring/blog posts
- Absence of evidence ‚â† evidence of absence

---

### üí° Discovery Question Priorities
Based on gaps, prioritize asking about:

**Technical Discovery**:
1. **Language standardization**: "What are your primary programming languages for backend and frontend development?"
2. **IaC security**: "How do you currently scan Terraform/CloudFormation for misconfigurations?"
3. **SIEM/logging**: "What's your approach to centralizing cloud security logs?"
4. **Application scanning**: "How do you scan your Python/React applications for vulnerabilities in the CI/CD pipeline?"
5. **Secrets management**: "How do you manage secrets and credentials across your development and cloud environments?"

**Business Context**:
1. **Application landscape**: "What are your mission-critical applications that need security coverage?"
2. **Data systems**: "What data warehouses or analytics platforms are you running in the cloud?"
3. **Coverage gaps**: "What parts of your cloud environment or application stack feel least visible from a security perspective?"

---

### üéØ Wiz Positioning Opportunities

**Language/Framework Coverage** (verified stack):
- ‚úÖ Python scanning (Wiz Code supports)
- ‚úÖ JavaScript/React scanning (Wiz Code supports)
- ‚úÖ Terraform/IaC scanning (Wiz Code + Cloud)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Go microservices (confirm scanning needs)

**Potential consolidation plays** (verified competitors):
- Prisma Cloud (CSPM) + Aqua (Container) + SonarQube (SAST) = Wiz Code + Cloud all-in-one
- [List only if you found verified tools]

**Capability gaps** (based on missing categories):
- IaC scanning at scale across Terraform
- Unified scanning for Python + React codebases
- Container registry scanning (if using ECR/private registry)
- Secrets detection in code and IaC
- API security for microservices architecture
- [List only confirmed gaps, not speculation]

**Application security coverage**:
- Cloud-native apps built with Python/React/Go need runtime + code scanning
- Kubernetes workloads need continuous posture management
- Multi-repo GitHub environment needs centralized security visibility

---

## Quality Standards
‚úÖ **DO**:
- Cite every claim with a source URL and date
- Rate confidence level for each finding (High/Medium/Low)
- Explicitly call out assumptions vs. verified facts
- Highlight what you couldn't find
- Note when evidence is circumstantial (e.g., "implies Python usage")
- Include programming language version info if available
- Keep one-liner summaries concise and copy-paste ready

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Guess or infer without labeling it as an assumption
- Present absence of evidence as confirmation
- Use outdated information without date stamps
- Include "likely uses X" without explaining reasoning
- Assume a language/app is used just because it's popular
- Conflate frameworks with languages (React ‚â† JavaScript)
- Overcomplicate the one-liner summaries with details

---

## Refresh Cadence
- **Before first meeting**: Full research
- **Before technical/demo deep dive**: Update with any new job postings or blog posts, focus on dev stack
- **Before security review**: Verify security tools and scanning coverage
- **Before close**: Final verification of tech stack for scoping/SOW, confirm language support needs

---

## Special Notes

### Programming Language Priority
Focus on:
1. **Production languages** (what they build products with)
2. **Infrastructure languages** (what they manage cloud with)
3. **Data languages** (what they analyze with)

### Application Priority
Focus on:
1. **Cloud-connected SaaS** (security implications)
2. **Data storage systems** (sensitive data concerns)
3. **Developer tools** (integration opportunities)
4. **Business-critical apps** (compliance requirements)

### One-Liner Usage
The Quick Reference section is designed to be:
- **Copy-paste ready** for other research prompts
- **Concise** (one line per category)
- **Accurate** (only verified tech, no assumptions)
- **Contextual** for sales conversations
```

Perfect! Now the output includes a **"Quick Reference - Tech Stack One-Liners"** section right after the Executive Summary that provides:

1. **Easy copy-paste** - Single lines ready to drop into Customer Alignment prompts
2. **Organized by category** - Matches the detailed sections below
3. **Verified only** - Only includes confirmed tech, not assumptions
4. **Includes gaps** - Has a "Critical Gaps" line so you know what's missing

Example output would look like:
```
**Cloud & Infrastructure**: "AWS (primary), Kubernetes orchestration, Cloudflare CDN"
**Programming Languages**: "Python (backend), React/TypeScript (frontend), Go (microservices)"
**Critical Gaps**: "No verified IaC scanning, SIEM unknown, secrets management unclear"
