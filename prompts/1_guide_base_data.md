## What to Add to NotebookLM

The more relevant prospect information added to NotebookLM, the better the AI-powered outputs will be. Think of this as the foundation that all subsequent research and prep work builds upon.

## Key Documents to Upload
- **Previous meeting notes** - Context from past conversations
- **Email threads** - Relevant correspondence with the prospect
- **Call Recordings or Zoom Notes** - Relevant meetings
- **Internal account notes** - CRM exports, Cognism data, marketing data, account plans, champion intel

## Essential URLs
- **Company website** - Homepage and About/Leadership pages
- **LinkedIn Company Page** - For org structure, employee count, recent posts
- **LinkedIn Profile(s)** - Key executives you'll be meeting (CIO, CISO, CTO, etc.)
- **Recent news articles** - Funding, acquisitions, leadership changes, incidents
- **Engineering/Tech blog** - If available (shows tech stack signals)
- **GitHub/GitLab** - Public repos (reveals development practices)

## Additional Documents to Upload
- **Their public security/compliance docs** - Annual reports, security whitepapers, compliance certifications
- **RFP/RFI documents** - If in active procurement process
- **Competitor intelligence** - Known tools they currently use

## Critical Data Points to Include
Even if you add them via URLs above, explicitly note:
- **Company name and industry vertical**
- **Headquarters location** (for regulatory context - UK/EU/US/etc.)
- **Employee count and revenue** (if known)
- **Cloud platforms in use** (AWS/Azure/GCP/multi-cloud)
- **Known security incidents or breaches**
- **Current security tools** (competitors to Wiz)
- **Compliance requirements** (FCA, GDPR, SOC2, ISO27001, etc.)
- **Key initiatives** (cloud migration, M&A, digital transformation)
- **Meeting participants** - Names, titles, roles

## Why This Matters
NotebookLM synthesizes ALL uploaded sources to generate:
- Value Pyramids
- 3Y Strategic Frameworks  
- Champion Plans
- MEDDPICC Gap Analysis
- Discovery Question Sets
- Meeting Prep Briefs

**The richer your base data, the more personalized and accurate these outputs become.**

## Pro Tips
✅ Upload docs in their native format when possible (PDF, DOCX)  
✅ Include contradictory sources - NotebookLM will surface conflicts  
✅ Add sources progressively as you learn more about the account  
✅ Use descriptive filenames so outputs can cite specific sources  
✅ Update base data after each customer interaction

## What NOT to Include
❌ Unverified rumors or assumptions  
❌ Confidential Wiz pricing or internal strategy docs (use Merlin Slackbot for that)  
❌ Irrelevant historical data from 3+ years ago  
❌ Generic industry reports (save those for Industry Intelligence step)
