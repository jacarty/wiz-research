**Purpose**: Conduct comprehensive business research on UK-headquartered companies to gather customer intelligence for sales strategy development.

## CRITICAL RESEARCH STANDARDS

This research must contain ONLY verified, sourced information.

**VERIFIED means:**

- Public record (Companies House, ICO, regulatory filings)
- Attributed statement in credible news source with publication date
- Official announcement or partnership press release

**NEVER include:**
- Assumptions based on "industry norms" or "typical for companies like this"
- Speculation about internal priorities without evidence
- "Likely" or "probably" statements without supporting evidence
- Information you cannot cite with a specific URL and date
- Single job posting as sole evidence (need 3+ for pattern validation)

**If you cannot verify something, write:** 
"NOT FOUND - No public information available. [Suggest discovery question to validate]"

- Include only the most relevant 3-5 findings per subsection
