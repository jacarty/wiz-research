Prompt: Generate 3Y Challenge Framework
Analyze all sources to create a 3-column summary for the "Securing Prospects Growth" slide framework:
Structure.

Column 1 (Y1): Business theme/goal
Each column: 3 challenge boxes with headers + 2-3 bullet points per box

Instructions:

Identify 3 primary business goals from discovery notes, website, and vertical context (democratizing security, continuous compliance, strengthening posture, etc.)
For each goal, extract 3 operational challenges related to:

Cloud security gaps/inefficiencies
Visibility & alerting limitations
Compliance/governance friction
Innovation/velocity blockers
Tool sprawl/consolidation needs


Use MEDDPICC context (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision criteria, Pain) to prioritize challenges with quantifiable impact
Reference tech stack analysis to ground challenges in their actual environment (AWS/Azure/GCP, current security tools, gaps)
Output format:

**[Business Theme]:** [Goal statement]
- Challenge 1: [Header] | [2-3 bullets on implications]
- Challenge 2: [Header] | [2-3 bullets on implications]  
- Challenge 3: [Header] | [2-3 bullets on implications]
Focus: Technical precision + business impact. Avoid generic statements. Use prospect's language from discovery notes where possible.
