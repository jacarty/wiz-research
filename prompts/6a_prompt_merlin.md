```

## EXAMPLE

**Good Alignment:**
"Priority: Scale to 10M users while reducing costs 15%"
→ Use-Case: Multi-cloud cost optimization + security
→ Outcome: $2M annual savings + unified visibility

**Poor Alignment:**
"Priority: Scale to 10M users..."
→ Use-Case: Container vulnerability scanning
→ Why poor: Doesn't address stated cost/scale priority

## QUALITY STANDARDS

- Lead with business outcomes, not technical features
- Rank by strategic fit to stated priorities
- Tailor to their verified tech stack and regulatory context
- No speculation—if it's not in the brief, don't assume it
