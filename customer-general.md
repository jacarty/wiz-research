## EXAMPLE RESEARCH OUTPUT SNIPPET

**Company Headquarters Location**
- **Finding**: Monzo Bank headquarters located in London, UK (Broadwalk House, 5 Appold St, London EC2A 2AG)
- **Source**: https://monzo.com/contact-us and Companies House record
- **Date**: Accessed October 2025
- **Reliability**: Official company source
- **Analysis**: London location indicates access to UK fintech talent pool and proximity to FCA regulation. Likely influenced by UK-specific cloud data residency requirements.

**Cloud Infrastructure Evidence**
- **Finding**: Monzo runs primarily on AWS, with services spanning multiple availability zones. Engineering blog confirms use of EKS (Kubernetes), Lambda, RDS, and S3.
- **Source**: https://monzo.com/blog/2024/06/15/cloud-architecture-evolution
- **Date**: June 2024
- **Reliability**: Official company tech blog
- **Relevant Quote**: "Our entire platform runs on AWS, leveraging managed services wherever possible to maintain our small infrastructure team's efficiency"
- **Analysis**: Strong AWS footprint makes Wiz Cloud a natural fit. Kubernetes usage indicates need for container security. Small infrastructure team suggests appetite for agentless, low-overhead solutions.

**Current Security Team Size**
- **Finding**: LinkedIn shows 12 employees with "Security" in job title at Monzo, including CISO. 3 current job openings for Security Engineers.
- **Source**: LinkedIn company page employee search + Monzo careers page
- **Date**: October 2025
- **Reliability**: Medium-high (LinkedIn data + official job postings)
- **Analysis**: Security team of ~12-15 people for a company of 2,500 employees suggests resource constraints. Active hiring indicates growing security function and potential urgency for force multiplication tools like Wiz.
